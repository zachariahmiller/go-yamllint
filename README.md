# go-yamllint

go-yamllint is a distribution of [yamllint][1], that can be built with Go. It does not actually reimplement any
functionality of yamllint in Go, instead packaging it with the WASI build of [Python][3], and 
executing with the pure Go Wasm runtime [wazero][2]. This means that `go install` or `go run`
can be used to execute it, with no need to rely on separate package managers such as pnpm,
on any platform that Go supports.

## Installation

Precompiled binaries are available in the [releases](https://github.com/wasilibs/go-yamllint/releases).
Alternatively, install the plugin you want using `go install`.

```bash
$ go install github.com/wasilibs/go-yamllint/cmd/yamllint@latest
```

To avoid installation entirely, it can be convenient to use `go run`

```bash
$ go run github.com/wasilibs/go-yamllint/cmd/yamllint@latest .
```

Note that due to the sandboxing of the filesystem when using Wasm, currently only files that descend
from the current directory when executing the tool are accessible to it, i.e., `../yaml/my.yaml` or
`/separate/root/my.yaml` will not be found.
